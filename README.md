# LLM-Science-Exam

Completed training and inference notebooks. Fine-tuned deberta-v3-large [^1] on chatgpt3.5 generated multiple choice questions related to scientific topics. Embedded prompts and Wikipedia content using sentence-transformers [^2][^3]to find exerpts likely to contain related information to prompts by embedding similarity. Performed inference to generate predictions for unseen questions generated in the same method.
